# Olive Oil Bio-Parameters Analysis

Analyze and classify olive oil types based on bio-parameters using clustering algorithms and the elbow method.

## Overview

The Olive Oil Bio-Parameters Analysis project is designed to determine distinct patterns or characteristics among different types of olive oil using clustering techniques and statistical analysis. The project focuses on identifying clusters based on bio-parameters to classify or categorize various olive oil samples.

## Project Goal

This project aims to explore a dataset containing bio-parameters (e.g., acidity levels, polyphenols, peroxide values) of different types or batches of olive oil. Through the application of clustering algorithms and assessment using the elbow method, the goal is to uncover underlying patterns or similarities within the dataset to aid in identifying olive oil types.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project contains bio-parameter measurements associated with various types or batches of olive oil. The dataset provides essential information necessary for the analysis and determination of patterns among the samples.

## Methodology


### Clustering Analysis

- Clustering algorithms (K-means) used to group olive oil samples.
- Utilization of the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

### Evaluation

- Assessment of cluster quality and interpretability.
- Visualization of clusters and their characteristics.

## Project Structure

- **data/:** Contains the dataset files.
- **notebooks/:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
- **results/:** Stores clustering results, visualizations, and analysis findings.
